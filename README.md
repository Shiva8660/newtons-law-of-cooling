# Newton's Law of Cooling â€“ Laplace Transform Based Modeling

This repository contains an academic project that models **Newtonâ€™s Law of Cooling** using **first-order differential equations** and solves it through **Laplace Transform techniques**. The project includes a detailed report and presentation submitted as part of **CS1802 â€“ Calculus and Laplace Transforms** in the 4th semester of B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering at **RV University**, Bengaluru.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

**Newtonâ€™s Law of Cooling** describes the rate at which an objectâ€™s temperature changes relative to the ambient temperature. The rate of heat loss is proportional to the temperature difference. This project:
- Formulates the law as a differential equation
- Solves it using Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms
- Analyzes and interprets the cooling curve
- Validates results with a graphical representation
